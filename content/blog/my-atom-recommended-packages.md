As a developer, a text editor is not something we can just ignore. Since I found out about atom, I never go back 😘. Even "visual studio code" clearly run faster on my machine, atom just feels right for me. If you are an atom guy/girl like me, here are some atom packages made by awesome community you might find useful:

- No Title Bar

 I don't like the title bar that hanging on top of my editor, let's get rid of it by using [No Title Bar](https://atom.io/packages/no-title-bar)

- PlatformIO IDE Terminal

Switching betweet atom and terminal/command prompt tab is tiring. [Platform IDE Terminal](https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide-terminal) enable us to play with terminal while still in atom's window

- Atom live server

You may heard "live reload" extension for your browser, to see some changes directly while you're working on a file. Yes! atom got you covered with [Atom live server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server)

- File icons

Staring at text editor is boring, let's give an icon to our treeview with [file icons package](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons)

### For HTML, CSS

- Pigments

To show how colors actually looks like, we can use [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments) instead remembering all the rgb and hexa number

- Color picker

While we're talking about color, this [color picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker) package can help us pick the right color without using an extra app

- Emmet

Do you work a lot with HTML? try using [emmet](https://emmet.io/) to make things easier! atom has a nice package for [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet)

Please, do let me know if i miss something!
