I still remember when one of my friend said to me "I don't use mouse, I'm a keyboard freak". I didn't really get the point back then, why would someone use mouse -less? isn't mouse there to help us work faster? In some cases, the answer is yes, but while I spend so much time work on mac laptop/computer, i already find myself keep looking for shortcut for certain task, since moving my hand from keyboard to mouse "takes time" and feels like I'm breaking the "zone".

Here are some common shortcuts that i use:

- Switch between app <kbd> cmd + tab </kbd>

- Switch between window on the same app <kbd> cmd + `</kbd>

- Switch tab <kbd> cmd + alt + arrow(left/right)</kbd> or <kbd> cmd + number</kbd>

- Open spotlight to search something <kbd> cmd + space</kbd>

- Close window/tab <kbd> cmd + W </kbd>, close app  <kbd> cmd + Q </kbd>

- Screen capture whole screen  <kbd> cmd + Shift + 3 </kbd>

- Screen capture certain area  <kbd> cmd + Shift + 4 </kbd> and drag the area you want

- Minimize a window <kbd> cmd + M</kbd>

- New window or new file (depend from the app) <kbd> cmd + N</kbd>
