snippet="With the demise of Microsoft's Mixer, the future of the Faster-Than-Light (FTL) streaming protocol has been left in doubt.  As the Internet's first practical subsecond streaming protocol, several successors to Mixer have decided to re-implement FTL from the original SDK and notes. While Mixer's original FTL specification had a de-facto specification in the form of ftl-sdk, the source code was in-complete, and several aspects of the FTL were left undocumented.   In an effort to keep FTL viable and cross-service compatible, this specification denotes a canonical implementation of FTL, handshake protocols, WebRTC notes, and all relevant information as relating to FTL with the hope that FTL may still be continued as a vechile for low latency video streaming over the Internet.
