snippet="Tank is an indexed store for your bits of stuff on the web, hypertexted for your pleasure. We call them tiddlers, keep them in tanks and work with them in compositions. Do with your tiddlers what you will: Make a wiki, keep your private or public notes, build single page applications, manage data over the API."
