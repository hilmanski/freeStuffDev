ðŸ›¸ NVMe / ðŸš€ SSD / ðŸ–´ HDD S.M.A.R.T Monitoring.

Why to use our tool? 
Because:
- You can share with others the disk info
- You can show how much hours has been the disk run without any errors
- You can show other when the disk is failing
- You can show temperature chart
- You also will have complete and original (without the serial number) s.m.a.r.t history of your disk(s) when sending s.m.a.r.t data to our api
- Our script also checks the disks in hardware raid, which normally smartctl without scripting it first wonÂ´t do
- And also you can get it working on windows, with the same things as above
- You contribute to our little community of disk fans who love s.m.a.r.t data, who love disks, who love to code things
