## FreeStuffDev
List of free services for developers like database, hosting, authentication and other stuff.  
Check it out at [freestuff.dev](https://freestuff.dev). 

I had many tools in my private repository and thought why not bring it to the public?
Surprisingly there are not many alternatives out there that focus on free programming tools, so I created my own dev-tool list to start prototyping or making an MVP.


Built with Hugo Static site generator and hosted at Netlify. (Now Astro on Vercel!)

## License

## Rules
1. Only accept free stuff or free trial at least 1 Year.
2. What is not suitable on this site:   
   - We're not accepting language/framework specific tools. 
   - Link to "part of specific tools" for example "themes for hugo"
   - Library for a certain framework/language, (e.g. Javascript library). 
   - Link to Documentation or Forum of a certain tool

They're great but there are more suitable place for those tools. 

## Contribute
Want to add new stuff?   
1a. Use this form
[Form New Stuff+](https://freestuff.dev/submit)  
it will prefill some value for your github Pull Request

1b. If you're going to create file manually (not via link above):

a. Fork repo  
b. Inside your fork navigate to `src/content/tools`  
c. Create a new file for service you want to add. File must have `.md` extension, i.e. `myservice.md`  
d. Use next template for content

```

P.S:

- You can use any image for thumbnail, but try to avoid using small favicons(16x16) as each **image will be resized to 80x80**
- For existing tags visit https://freestuff.dev/ and open the "Filter"
- At the end write the features as one feature per line
