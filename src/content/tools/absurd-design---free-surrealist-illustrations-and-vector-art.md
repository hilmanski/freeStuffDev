snippet: "Absurd Design is a creative platform that offers a collection of free, unique, hand-drawn illustrations. These illustrations are quirky, imperfect, and designed to add a human and artistic touch to digital projects. The style often features abstract, playful, and exaggerated elements, making them stand out in contrast to typical polished and realistic vector graphics."
