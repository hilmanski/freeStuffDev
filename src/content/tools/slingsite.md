# Unlimited image and video compression optimized for web usage.
Compression happens very fast on your browser. The image never goes to a server. So, privacy is absolute.

## Image Compression
You can compress images in bulk. For each image you add, you get 9 compressed versions: JPG, WEBP and AVIG for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile resolutions.

## Video Compression
You can compress videos in bulk. For each video you add, you get 9 compressed videos and 9 compressed images (the poster images). Your videos come out in the 3 selected resolutions with WebM (codec VP9), MP4 (codec HEVC aka H.265) and MP4 (codec AVC aka H.264).
