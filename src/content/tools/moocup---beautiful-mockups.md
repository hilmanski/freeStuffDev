Iâ€™ve always seen talented designers and developers post their work, only for it to get lost in the noise. I realized a major reason is that they often just post a simple, unstyled screenshot. As a result, nobody pays attention.

My solution is a tool where you can drop in a screenshot, pick from a collection of hand-picked gradients, style it, and export itâ€”all in a few seconds. Iâ€™ve carefully designed every element of the app to be efficient, simple, and intuitive.

On making it "Free, Forever": I don't plan on ever charging a subscription for Moocup. 
I dislike the subscription model as much as you do. Instead, my plan is to include a donation option for those who wish to support the project. This allows me to keep my promise of making the app free and useful for everyone, without being burdened by hosting and maintenance costs.

My goal is simple: to provide a high-quality tool that is genuinely useful and doesn't waste your time. If you find it helpful, the best thing you can do is share it with others. I've included all my contact links for feedback and suggestions.
